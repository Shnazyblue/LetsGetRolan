            My name is Rolando J Acevedo Jr. I was born and raised in North East
            Philadelphia. I graduated from Penn State University August 2018
            with a BS in Information Science & Technology. Currently employed at
            the University of Providence IT department for over a year.

          <p>
            Current webmaster for the University of Providence webpage. Due to
            the lack of web administrator, I was given this extra responsibility
            because of the excellent quality of work I provided for my
            day-to-day responsibilities. Aside from some minor web projects I've
            done for myself, I had little experience with an enterprise level
            web project such as this. However, since being given this
            responsibility, I've been training myself with the most up-to-date
            industry standards and practices in order to best service the
            University website and help prep it for standard and technology
            changes to come.

          <h3>Job Role</h3>
          <h4>Service Desk Lead</h4>
          <p>
            I handle many daily tasks throughout the day. This includes:
            provinding training for over 30 staff and faculty, quickly handling
            incidents arriving by phone or ticketing system, checking Sophos
            Central to make sure computers are up to date and maintain security
            compliance on servers and end user systems. Over the summer I
            replaced and imaged every computer on campus while maintaining a
            detailed inventory list within our ticketing system.
